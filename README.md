# Instagram Aesthetic AI Agent

An AI-powered agent that analyzes an Instagram account’s existing aesthetic and automatically generates on-brand post concepts, design briefs, and captions optimized for engagement goals such as saves, shares, or comments.

This project focuses on **automation + consistency**: instead of manually deciding what to post, the agent learns your visual and textual style once, stores it as memory, and uses it to curate future posts that fit your grid.

## Core Idea

The agent operates as a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Aesthetic Ingestion** – Analyze existing Instagram posts (via grid screenshots)
2. **Style Extraction** – Extract color palette, contrast, layout density, and caption voice
3. **Aesthetic Memory** – Store a reusable style profile
4. **Post Generation** – Produce post concepts, design briefs, and captions
5. **Optimization & Ranking** – Score outputs based on aesthetic fit and post goal
6. **Export** – Provide Canva/Figma-ready design instructions and captions

The result is a repeatable, automated workflow for creating Instagram content that stays visually and tonally consistent.

## System Architecture



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
